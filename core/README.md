# Krystal Core

> Power mapping algorithms for transparency and accountability

Krystal Core is the engine behind power structure analysis, providing sophisticated algorithms to map and analyze relationships between powerful entities across news media, government, and corporate sectors.

## 🎯 What Makes Krystal Different

While apps like **Ground News** focus on media bias and source comparison, Krystal Core specializes in **structural power analysis** - mapping the actual relationships and influence networks between powerful entities.

| Feature | Ground News | Krystal Core |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Primary Focus** | Media bias comparison | Power structure mapping |
| **Data Source** | News outlets | Entity relationships + news |
| **Analysis Type** | Narrative comparison | Network influence analysis |
| **Output** | Bias spectrum | Power network graphs |
| **Value Proposition** | "See all sides" | "See who's connected" |

## 🔬 Core Algorithms

### Network Influence Scoring

```python
class PowerMapper:
    def calculate_influence_score(entity, network_graph):
        """
        Multi-factor influence scoring combining:
        - Network centrality measures
        - Institutional authority weights
        - Historical relationship strength
        - Cross-sector connectivity
        """
